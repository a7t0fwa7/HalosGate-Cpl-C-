# HalosGate-Cpl-C-
Halos Gate implementation in C++.

A malicious control panel applet with AES encryption for the payload and process injection with custom syscalls into a notepad process, no sandbox evasion at the moment but i will add it eventually.

Change the file extension to ".cpl" and it can be executed by simply doubleclicking on the file.
